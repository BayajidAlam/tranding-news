      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Difference Between var, let, and const in JavaScript</h3>
      <p>In JavaScript, variables can be declared using three different methods: var, let, and const. In this blog, we will discuss the differences between these three ways of creating variables.

        <p class="text-xl font-bold mt-3">Variable Declaration in JavaScript</p>
        In the early days of JavaScript, there was only one way to declare variables and that was using the var keyword. However, there were some issues associated with variables declared using the var keyword so it was necessary to evolve new ways for variable declaration. With the advent of ES6, now developers are able to define variables according to their specific needs, thanks to two new keywords: let and const.
        
        All three of these three keywords have similarities in their syntax for declaring variables. However, they differ in their usage and scope, as detailed in the next section.
        
        
        <p class="text-xl font-bold mt-3">var, let, and const Variable Declaration in JavaScript</p>
        The differences between var, let, and const variable declaration in JavaScript include:
        Variables declared with var and const are scoped to the immediate function body.
        Variables declared with the var keyword are hoisted. Hoisting means that the variable can be accessed in their enclosing scope even before they are declared.
        Variables declared with the let keyword are block-scoped, which means the variables will have scope to the immediate enclosing block.

      <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">The Difference Between Regular Functions and Arrow Functions</h2>
      <p>Arrow function — also called fat arrow function— is a new feature introduced in ES6 that is a more concise syntax for writing function expressions. While both regular JavaScript functions and arrow functions work in a similar manner, there are certain differences between them.</p>

      <ul class="text-xl font-bold">
        <li>1. Syntax</li>
        <li>2. Arguments binding</li>
        <li>3. Use of this keyword</li>
        <li>4. Using new keyword</li>
        <li>5. No duplicate named parameters</li>
      </ul>

      <h1 class="text-xl font-bold mt-1">.forEach(), .map(), .find .filter() .... What's the difference?</h1>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-1">forEach()</h3>
      <p>.forEach(), is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and it returns undefined.</p>
      
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-1">.map():</h3>
      <p>.map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-1">.filter():</h3>
      <p>.filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-1">.find()</h3>
      <p>The find() method returns the value of the first element that passes a test.

        The find() method executes a function for each array element.
        
        The find() method returns undefined if no elements are found.
        
        The find() method does not execute the function for empty elements.
        
        The find() method does not change the original array.
